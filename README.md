# Golang Comprehensive Course: From Basics to Microservices

## Course Description

This course offers an in-depth exploration of the Go programming language (Golang) with a focus on building scalable and efficient applications. Participants will learn Golang fundamentals, concurrency patterns, and interface design, and will advance to developing REST APIs, implementing gRPC and GraphQL services, and designing microservice architectures. The course will also cover the integration with PostgreSQL, containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and infrastructure management using Terraform.

## Course Objectives

- Master the fundamentals of the Go programming language.
- Understand how to interact with PostgreSQL using Go.
- Learn to containerize Go applications with Docker.
- Gain practical experience with Kubernetes for app deployment.
- Implement RESTful APIs, gRPC services, and GraphQL endpoints.
- Design and build scalable microservice architectures.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts and databases.
- Familiarity with command line interfaces and text editors.
